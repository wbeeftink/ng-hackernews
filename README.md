# NgHackernews

This project is yet another Hackernews clone. I created this project to learn Angular and will use it in the future to test new features. It shows the feeds from Hackernews (Top, New, Show, Ask & Jobs) in a more readable fashion and it also suitable for mobile devices. It uses [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) for the UI.

## Acknowledgments

This project is heavily inspired by [vue-hackernews-2.0](https://vue-hn.now.sh/) by [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803). It uses the [Hacker News (unofficial) API](https://github.com/cheeaun/node-hnapi) by [Lim Chee Aun](https://github.com/cheeaun). I later discovered [HNPWA](https://hnpwa.com/) which I also used for inspiration.
