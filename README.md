This project is yet another Hackernews clone using the [Hacker News (unofficial) API](https://github.com/cheeaun/node-hnapi). I was heavily inpsired by [vue-hackernews-2.0](https://vue-hn.now.sh/). I created this project to learn Angular and will use it in the future to test new features. It shows the feeds from [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) (Top, New, Show, Ask & Jobs) in a more readable fashion and is also suitable for mobile devices. It uses [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) for the UI layer.

## Features

Some of the features I implemented so far:

* Usable UI using Angular Material
* Responsiveness
* Progressive web app features
* Speed - it's fast!
* Offline capabilities (although limited)
* Hosted and CI with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
* Error logging with [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/)

There are several features I have on my wishlisht which I might or might not implement. I will add features when I have time or a real life use case for which I will use this project as test case.

## Benchmarks

There's (always) room for improvement but with basic features the project scores 100/100 for PWA features in Lighthouse. My next area of focus should be performance. Especially third party content and critical CSS.
